# Beginner-ML-Projects
This repository upholds my Machine Learning projects which I did to understand the foundations of
preprocessing the data and foundations of Machine Learning. Implemented various algorithms from 
Simple Linear Regressio, Logistic Regression to Support Vector Machines and Decision Trees.
These projects helped me to undeestand how the real world data is represented and how it is actually manipulated
and get insights from.
