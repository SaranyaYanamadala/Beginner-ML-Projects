**Machine Learning Projects**

This repository contains a collection of Machine Learning projects that I worked on to gain a deeper understanding of the foundations of preprocessing data and the principles of Machine Learning.

**Project Overview**

In these projects, I implemented various algorithms, including:

* Simple Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* K Nearest Neighbors
* Support Vector Machines
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest
  
These projects allowed me to gain hands-on experience with real-world data and understand how it is represented, manipulated, and analyzed to gain insights.

**Skills Learned**

Through these projects, I developed a solid understanding of:

* Data preprocessing techniques
* Machine Learning algorithms and their applications
* Data visualization and interpretation
